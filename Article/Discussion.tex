\section{Discussion}

		Our work has a number of limitations that we plan to conquer in future. To achieve higher recall in cases extraction and to adopt the extraction of compound sentences, we will use statistical and machine learning method to complement rule-based method to make it more flexible. 
		
		In future work, we would like to analyze the computational complexity of using the MI Shapley Inconsistency Value, develop algorithms and implementations (possibly based on approximation techniques), and undertake case studies of applications of this value.
