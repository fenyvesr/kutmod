		\gls{SDLC} starts with eliciting the \gls{SRS}, noted by the stakeholders. As stakeholders use their own language to state their requirements, it is observed to be very often ambiguous and confusing to analyze and subsequently design the desired solution. In order to help, \gls{NLP} concepts are found to be helpful for the analysis. \gls{NLP} system processes the data written in natural
		language in an intelligent manner and generates an information which is comparatively easier to analyze.\cite{Tripathy}]
		Using \gls{NLP} can help in:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item the syntax of natural language
			\item the lexical context of the words
			\item the semantic components which construct the literal meaning of a sentence
			\item the pragmatic components which construct non-literal meaning of a sentence
			\item the parser generating the phrase tree structure of a sentence.
		\end{itemize}
		\gls{POST} is a semantic analysis approach and deals with assigning one or more \gls{POS} to a given word. The different types of \gls{POS} are,
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Noun (names): a word or lexical item denoting any abstract (abstract noun: e.g. home) or concrete entity (concrete noun: e.g. house); a person (police officer, Michael), place (coastline, London), thing (necktie, television), idea (happiness), or quality (bravery). Nouns can also be classified as count nouns or non-count nouns; some can belong to either category. The most common part of speech; they are called naming words.
			\item Pronoun (replace or again placed): a substitute for a noun or noun phrase (them, he). Pronouns make sentences shorter and clearer since they replace nouns.
			\item Adjective (describes, limits): a modifier of a noun or pronoun (big, brave). Adjectives make the meaning of another word (noun) more precise.
			\item Verb (states action or being): a word denoting an action (walk), occurrence (happen), or state of being (be). Without a verb a group of words cannot be a clause or sentence.
			\item Adverb (describes, limits): a modifier of an adjective, verb, or another adverb (very, quite). Adverbs make language more precise.
			\item Preposition (relates): a word that relates words to each other in a phrase or sentence and aids in syntactic context (in, of). Prepositions show the relationship between a noun or a pronoun with another word in the sentence.
			\item Conjunction (connects): a syntactic connector; links words, phrases, or clauses (and, but). Conjunctions connect words or group of words.
			\item Interjection (expresses feelings and emotions): an emotional greeting or exclamation (Huzzah, Alas). Interjections express strong feelings and emotions.
			\item Article (describes, limits): a grammatical marker of definiteness (the) or indefiniteness (a, an). The article is not always listed among the parts of speech. It is considered by some grammarians to be a type of adjective or sometimes the term 'determiner' (a broader class) is used.
		\end{itemize}
		Identification of all these \gls{POS} makes the task of \gls{NLP} simpler.
