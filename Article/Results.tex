		In this paper, we contributed an approach to extract functional requirements from free text documents for supporting domain analysis. We proposed an extended variability model to help the detailed and integrated expression of product line functional requirements. And then we automatically convert dependency relations of words in a sentence into cases to support the modeling of the variability of product line functional requirements.
